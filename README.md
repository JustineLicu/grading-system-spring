# Grading System (Spring)

A grading system with decision support for CvSU Imus.

## Usage

Spring Boot 3 requires `Java 17`. If your version is different, you can download it here:
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/java/openjdk/download#openjdk-17>

> If you are using `VS Code`, install the recommended extensions for this project by searching
> `@recommended` in the Extensions tab.

**Step 1:** Run this Spring Boot application using your IDE, or by running the command below.

```sh
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

**Step 2:** That's it! You can now test the API endpoints using the `.http` files in the `http`
folder, or by using Postman.
